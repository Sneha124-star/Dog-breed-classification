# Dog-breed-classification

This notebook builds an end to end multi-class image of dog breeds using tensor flow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.The data is obtained from kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data. 
The evaluation is a file with the prediction possibilities for each dog breed of each test image.

We are delaing with unstructured data. So we use deep learning and transfer learning. There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are around 120 diffrent classes).

There are around 10,000+ images in the test sets.(which do not have labels, cuz we will have to predict them) There are around 10,000+ images in the train sets.(which have labels)
